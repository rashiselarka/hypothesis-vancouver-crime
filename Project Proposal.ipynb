    "\n",
    "Large-scale studies of crime data from the FBI demonstrates that violent crimes often happen at night (Bannister, 2019). This statement seems reasonable since the victims are easier targets and witnesses become unlikely. We wanted to test this statement, and take it a step further by examining how different types of crimes may correlate with the time they take place at, and if we can attempt to predict when theyâ€™ll take place by looking at (seemingly) similar crimes and testing if they occur at similar times.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have used the Vancouver crime data found on the Vancouver Police Department's website for our analysis. We plan use this data to calculate the estimated average time for which most of the comparable crimes in the dataset occur, and come up with a hypothesis test to see if these crime, in their time of occurence are actually comparable or not. Through this investigation, we hope to gain not just a better understanding of hypothesis testing, but also of the time of day we are more vulnerable to certain crimes (Brands, 2013).\n",
    "\n",
    "The large data set that we are using was obtained from the Vancouver Police Department: https://geodash.vpd.ca/opendata/ and consists of various attributes associated with the documentation from when the crime was recorded. This is a dataset of crime data on a year-by-year basis beginning in 2003. This data is designed to provide individuals with a general overview of incidents falling into several crime categories. We will be using these attributes to construct our model and we also aim to find out which of these attributes just seem comparbale, or are truly comparable. \n"

A boxplot for the sample population is created, sample because irl we don't have access to entire population, is used to visualize the data distribution.   \n",
    "\n",
    "We then plan to collect bootstrap samples and visualize the samplign distributions of the means for our targetted attributes. We will conduct a one-tailed hypothesis test on whether vehicle collision or pedestrian struck with fatality occurs later than just that with injury, as well as a two-tailed one on if theft of vehicle and theft from vehicle occur at similar times. We will use the mean and standard deviation as descriptive statistics to make inferences, to arrive upon conclusions about whether differences exist, and what they are using confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect our results to corroborate the alternate hypotheses - that car accidents involving death happen later than just ones with injury, since drivers tend to go at higher speeds at night, there is lower visibility and more drunk and reckless drivers on the road. And we expect that theft of vehicle and theft from vehicle doesnâ€™t happen at around the same time of day on average as offense theft from vehicle can take place all throughout the day depending on the neighbourhood whereas theft of vehicle is likely to happen when itâ€™s more isolated (perhaps later at night).\n",
    "\n",
    "It most crucially provides insight into how law enforcement could go about predicting the time during which certain types of crimes are likely to occur. The questions that arise for the future are many - other than time of day, what are other predictors we could look at; perhaps certain months when crime spikes? Also, if perhaps the month and time of day are related? Maybe crime could occur at earlier hours in the winter months because it gets dark sooner, etc."
